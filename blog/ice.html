                        This is a trigger warning.

                <p>At first, I was thinking that I'd start my first writing piece on this website with something silly, wholesome, nothing that takes much time to talk about or read. My thought process was that it'd be easy and fast for both the reader and I.</p>
                <br>
                <p>However, after seeing more and more of these horrid ghastly scenes popping up on my feed, which are basically everywhere now, I knew that I had to address it properly, because we must recognise it as the truly despicable situation that it is.</p>
                <br>
                <p>This, unfortunately, means that this text will contain painful topics for some, including myself. But, politics isn't supposed to be fun, or optional for that matter. The very fact that you are living and breathing obligates you to educate yourself about what is right and wrong, and to then educate others about it as well.</p>

                <p>For anyone living under a rock, the Immigration and Customs Enforcement, better known as ICE, is the result of the merging of 2 customs and immigration services in 2003. (<a href="https://www.ice.gov/about-ice" target="_blank">Source <i class="fas fa-external-link-alt"></i></a>)</p>
                <br>
                <p>So, why is an organization that was functionally created under George W. Bush getting into so many headlines now in 2026? We're not here for any short answers, so let's get straight into it.</p>
                <br>
                <p>The fact is that ICE has actually been causing serious abuses since it was made, but what ended up happening is that Trump has turned it into something uniquely monstrous, as we can clearly see that it has become far more visible, aggressive, and ideologically empowered.</p>
                <br>
                <p>A much more fitting definition of what ICE is, made by me after considering all of the facts, is that they're essentially a major paramilitary organization in practice, whose efforts work to serve as an instrument of terror based on a racist ideology, in order to kidnap illegal immigrants and put them in concentration camps across the country. An almost word for word definition for the Schutzstaffel, better known as the SS under Adolf Hitler in what was Nazi Germany. (<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Schutzstaffel" target="_blank">Wikipedia: SS <i class="fas fa-external-link-alt"></i></a>)</p>
                <br>
                <p>Now, I know what some of you might be thinking, comparing them to these Nazi-built ideas is just overexaggerating, right? I'm here to tell you now, it fucking isn't. I will cover an extremely small portion of everything they have done as of today. Mind you, what follows is not an opinion, but documented common practices carried out by ICE:</p>

                <p>This very minuscule sample of countless many others is only the tip of the iceberg. There is so much more that if I wanted to incorporate in this one blog article, it'd probably take up the entire website's data. For this reason, I encourage you to do your own research, educate others, and most importantly, speak up for those who can't.</p>
